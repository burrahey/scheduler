Notes
- get rid of all the extra devise links


To do:
permissions
associates can add/edit/delete shifts for themselves on an existing schedule
associates can edit themselves
supervisors can add/edit/delete shifts for everyone on an existing schedule
supervisors can edit/delete employees
supervisors can view unpublished schedules
associates can only view published schedules
- can add/edit/delete if you're the employee who owns the shift. can view if you're logged in
and create  employees/1/shifts/new

- add permissions for admins. disallow everything by non-logged in users


round 2:
- you should be able to click the schedule to add, edit or delete a shift WITHOUT an employee. SHIFTS CONTROLLER!
- you can assign an employee to a shift or switch it out easily
- you should be able to change employees for a shift - a shift should be tied to its schedule, NOT its employee
